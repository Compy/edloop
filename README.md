Programmable True Bypass Guitar Effects Looper

This is an incomplete project. The code for the Arduino is written. The main board has been prototyped and bench tested. I have not packaged it all in a housing and actually gigged with it yet. The mute circuit was an after-thought and has not been tested at all.

Don't expect this to work out of the box. I'm sure it has more than one bug.

The main Arduino code in src/edloop.ino has been fairly well documented.

A main board schematic (gschem) can be found in sch/.

A higher level description of the looper's operation is in doc/manual.txt.

A top and bottom picture of the main board is in img/.

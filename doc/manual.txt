  Operation (For later user document)
  ==========================================================================

  Upon boot PRESET mode is selected. Bank 0 is selected. Preset 1 is
  selected. If this is the first time the system is booted, 0x0000 will be
  read from preset address 0:0 where the first digit is the bank, the second
  is the offset. This will turn all relays off. The guitar signal will bypass
  all loops and be muted at the output. CTRL1/2 will be off.

  PRESET Mode
  -----------
  Switches OUT1/2 and CTL1/2 are ignored but their hard-wired LEDs will
  reflect their relay states.
  
  Switches LP1-10 will select a preset and toggle the relays and associated
  preset LED. If the same LP switch is selected successively it is considered
  a no-op.

  The BANK switch will increment the 7 seg display. If the active preset is
  not in the bank displayed. The bank display will flash. If one of the
  LP1-LP10 switches is selected, that preset will be loaded and the bank will
  stop flashing.

  The MODE switch will cause the unit to enter MANUAL mode.
  
  MANUAL Mode
  -----------
  All switches are active except BANK. The BANK display will show the bank
  that was active before entering MANUAL mode.

  * OUT1/2 will toggle the output relays.
  * CTL1/2 will toggle the control relays.
  * LP1-LP10 will toggle their associated loop relays.

  The MODE switch will cause the unit to do one of two things depending on the
  fourth bit of the the mini dip config switch.

  * 0
    PROGRAM mode is entered.
  * 1
    PRESET mode is re-entered. The preset that was active before MANUAL mode
    was entered is loaded (from a cached value, not ROM). This effectively
    wipes the state of the loops that were toggled during MANUAL mode.

  PROGRAM Mode
  ------------
  Switches OUT1/2 and CTL1/2 are ignored. Preset LEDs 1-10 are cycled. At this
  point the system is waiting for one of four things to happen.
  1. The BANK switch can optionally be used to select a bank to write to.
  2. One of switch LP01-LP10 may be selected. The state of the relays are read
     and saved in ROM. PRESET mode is then automatically selected with the
     just programmed preset active.
  3. The MANUAL switch may be used to re-enter PRESET mode. The previously
     active bank and preset is reloaded from RAM. This effectively wipes the
     state of the relays that may have been changed during the previous MANUAL
     mode.

  Note: The write-protect dip switch is ignored in PROGRAM mode. If its state
        changes in PROGRAM mode, it will not be honored until the next MANUAL
	=> PROGRAM transition occurs
  
  Switches
  ===========================================================================

  OUT1 and OUT2
  -------------
  Only active in MANUAL mode.
  Toggle their relays on/off. OUT1 will direct the signal to the OUT1 mono
  jack. OUT2 will direct the signal to the OUT2 mono jack.

  CTL1 and CTL2
  -------------
  Only active in MANUAL mode.
  CTL1 will short the tip to sleeve of the stereo CTL jack.
  CTL2 will short the ring to sleeve of the stereo CTL jack.

  LP1 through LP10
  -----------------
  Active in any mode.
  In PRESET mode, each switch will load a preset from cached RAM. In MANUAL
  mode each switch will toggle its associated loop relay. In PROGRAM mode the
  selected switch will cause the system to save the state of the relays into
  ROM.

  MODE
  ----
  Change the mode of the unit. One of PRESET, MANUAL, or PROGRAM.

  BANK
  ----
  Increment the 7 segment display. After the maximum bank is displayed, reset
  the display to 0.

  Displays
  ===========================================================================
  
  OUT1 and OUT2 LEDs (red)
  -----------------
  Indicate the state of the OUT1/2 switches. Off is muted. These are
  hard-wired to their relay circuits.

  CTL1 and CTL2 LEDs (red)
  ------------------------
  Indicate the state of the CTL1/2 switches. On is active. These are
  hard-wired to their relay circuits.

  LP1-LP10 Relay Status LEDs (red)
  --------------------------------
  Indicate if the associated loop is active. On means the effect is in the
  signal chain. These are hard-wired to their relay circuits.

  LP1-LP10 Preset Status LEDs (blue)
  ----------------------------------
  Indicate the active preset in PRESET and MANUAL mode. In PROGRAM mode all 10
  LEDs are cycled to inform the user to select one to write to.

  MODE RGB LED
  ------------
  Blue for PRESET mode, red for MANUAL mode, and yellow for PROGRAM mode.
  
  BANK 7 Segment Display
  ----------------------
  Indicate the active bank.
  If the display is flashing, the displayed preset LED and displayed bank are
  out of sync. This only occurs in PRESET mode. Select a preset and the
  display will stop flashing.

  I/O Jacks
  ==========================================================================

  Guitar In
  ---------
  1/4" mono.

  Effects Loops
  -------------
  * 1/4" mono send x 10.
  * 1/4" mono return x 10.

  Amp Control
  -----------
  1/4" stereo. Tip controls one function, ring controls another.

  Amp Output
  ----------
  * 1/4" mono to amp 1.
  * 1/4" mono to amp 2.

  Config Switches
  ===========================================================================
  The 4 input mini DIP switch is used to configure the unit.

  Switch 2, 3 and 4 set the maximum bank that can be accessed.

                       +---------+
                       | | | | | |

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

  The far left switch is used to prevent overwriting presets. If ON, PROGRAM
  mode cannot be selected with the MODE switch. The mode will toggle back and
  forth between PRESET and MANUAL.

  All switches can be modified during operation with one caveat. If the Write
  Protect switch is enabled while in Program Mode, the switch will not be
  honored until the next time an attempt to enter Program Mode occurs.
